# 42 Piscine - My Programming Journey

## About the Piscine

The **42 piscine** is an intense, month-long coding bootcamp that serves as the entry to the 42 network. During this period, I completed a variety of programming challenges designed to test my problem-solving skills, efficiency in C programming, and ability to manage memory. It was a test of both individual and collaborative work, often under time constraints, with a focus on algorithms and data structures.

## Challenges and Skills Acquired

During the piscine, I worked on the following:

- **Algorithm Design**: Solving problems with optimal efficiency.
- **C Programming**: Writing low-level code with a focus on memory management.
- **Data Structures**: Understanding and implementing structures like arrays, linked lists, and trees.
- **Time Management**: Completing tasks within strict deadlines.
- **Collaboration**: Working in teams to solve more complex challenges.

## Key Projects

Some key projects I completed during the piscine include:

- **Libft**: Rewriting basic C library functions.
- **Get Next Line**: Implementing a function to read a line from a file descriptor.
- **Push_swap**: Sorting numbers using the fewest moves.
- **Fractal**: Generating fractals using recursive algorithms.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **C Programming**: Primary language used throughout the piscine.
- **Git**: Version control for collaboration and project management.
- **Makefiles**: Automating the compilation process.

## Conclusion

The piscine was a highly demanding experience that pushed me to improve my coding skills and adapt to a fast-paced programming environment. It was both challenging and rewarding, and it helped me develop a strong foundation in problem-solving and software development.
